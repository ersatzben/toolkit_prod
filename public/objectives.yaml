  - name: "Increase business R&D investment"
    tag: "increase_business_rd_investment"
    description: "This objective focuses on stimulating private sector investment in research and development activities to foster innovation and economic growth."
    notes: "Achieving this often involves a mix of financial incentives, like tax relief, and creating a stable economic environment that encourages long-term planning. Consideration should be given to the balance between broad support and targeted interventions for specific sectors. A trade-off can be the cost to the Exchequer versus the potential for future economic returns and ensuring that incentives genuinely drive additional R&D, rather than subsidising existing plans."

  - name: "Support SME innovation"
    tag: "support_sme_innovation"
    description: "Aimed at enhancing the innovation capacity of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) by providing targeted support and resources."
    notes: "SMEs often require more than just funding; access to expertise, simplified administrative processes, and support for navigating complex regulatory landscapes are vital. It's important to tailor support to the diverse needs of SMEs, from start-ups to established businesses. A potential trade-off is the administrative effort required to reach a large number of small firms versus focusing resources on fewer, potentially higher-growth, companies."

  - name: "Support early-stage research"
    tag: "support_early_stage_research"
    description: "Encourages foundational research and exploration of new scientific and technological frontiers."
    notes: "This requires a high tolerance for risk and an acceptance that many projects may not yield immediate commercial results. Protecting academic freedom and investigator-led research is important. The trade-off is between funding purely curiosity-driven research with uncertain long-term pay-offs and directing funds towards research with more foreseeable applications."

  - name: "Solve government challenges"
    tag: "solve_government_challenges"
    description: "Utilises innovation to address specific challenges faced by public sector bodies and improve public services."
    notes: "This can involve challenge prizes, innovation partnerships with the private sector, or adopting new technologies within government. A culture of experimentation and risk-taking within the public sector is beneficial. The trade-off is the potential for public funds to be spent on unproven solutions versus the opportunity to deliver better public services more efficiently."

  - name: "Create markets for innovation"
    tag: "create_markets_for_innovation"
    description: "Aims to establish or shape markets for novel products and services, de-risking private investment in innovative ventures."
    notes: "Public procurement can be a powerful tool, as can outcome-based regulation or the use of standards to drive demand for innovative solutions. It's important to design these interventions carefully to avoid unintended consequences or creating artificial markets. The trade-off is the potential for higher initial costs in public spending or regulation, versus the long-term benefits of a more innovative economy."

  - name: "Support applied R&D commercialisation"
    tag: "support_applied_rd_commercialisation"
    description: "Facilitates the translation of applied research findings into commercially viable products, processes, and services."
    notes: "This involves bridging the 'valley of death' between research and market-ready products through mechanisms like proof-of-concept funding, access to testing facilities, and business mentoring. Understanding market needs is critical. A trade-off can be ensuring that public support doesn't crowd out private investment or unduly favour certain companies."

  - name: "Support collaborative R&D"
    tag: "support_collaborative_rd"
    description: "Promote joint research and development projects between different organisations, such as businesses, universities, and research institutions, to share knowledge and resources. Effective collaboration requires clear frameworks for intellectual property ownership and benefit sharing. Building trust and facilitating networking between diverse partners is key. Consideration should be given to the potential for 'free-rider' issues or ensuring that collaborations genuinely add value beyond what individual entities could achieve. The trade-off might be the complexity of managing multi-partner projects against the potential for more impactful, interdisciplinary breakthroughs."

    tag: "support_growth_driving_sectors"
    description: "Provide targeted assistance to industries identified as having high potential to expand and contribute significantly to overall economic growth. Identifying future growth sectors requires robust analysis and foresight, avoiding 'picking winners' without a clear rationale. Policy should be adaptable as sectors evolve. The main trade-off is the risk of misallocating resources if predictions are incorrect or if support creates market distortions, versus the potential for accelerated growth in key areas."

    tag: "support_adoption_new_technologies"
    description: "Encourage and facilitate the uptake and integration of new and advanced technologies by businesses and other organisations to improve productivity and competitiveness. This often requires addressing barriers such as lack of awareness, skills gaps, implementation costs, and perceived risks. Demonstration projects and advice services can be effective. Consideration should be given to ensuring benefits are widely shared and that adoption doesn't exacerbate digital divides. The trade-off is the cost of support programmes versus the potential productivity gains across the economy."

    description: "Expand the availability of individuals with advanced education, training, and expertise in areas critical for innovation and economic growth. This involves long-term investment in education and skills training, from schools through to universities and vocational pathways, as well as attracting and retaining international talent. Collaboration with industry to define skills needs is essential. The trade-off is the significant time lag between investment in education and seeing the impact on the workforce, versus the immediate need for skilled individuals in a fast-changing economy."
