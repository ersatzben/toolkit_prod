    tag: "r_d_tax_reliefs"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "Support companies in investing in innovative projects across science and technology sectors. By reducing the effective cost of R&D through tax relief, the policy seeks to unlock additional private sector investment and drive economic growth, particularly encouraging businesses that might otherwise underinvest in research and development."
      optimal_conditions: "Works best in environments with an established business base, mature tax infrastructure, and stable fiscal outlook. Particularly effective when broad-based R&D stimulus is needed rather than targeted support."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "Companies submit documentation detailing their qualifying R&D expenditure and can claim a taxable credit at 20% under the Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) scheme. Loss-making R&D-intensive SMEs can access Enhanced R&D Intensive Support (ERIS) with an enhanced deduction of 86% and payable tax credit up to 14.5%. The system operates through existing tax infrastructure, with companies claiming relief through their regular tax returns."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**Low** – broad eligibility across all sectors"
      technological: "**Low** – cannot target specific technologies or innovation priorities"
      regional: "**Low** – no geographic differentiation in rates or eligibility"
      by_firm_type: "**Moderate** – separate schemes for SMEs vs larger companies (ERIS vs RDEC)"
      overall_assessment: "**Broad-brush tool** – excellent for general R&D stimulus, poor for strategic targeting."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Delivers impressive leverage with £7.5B in relief generating £46.7B in R&D spending. Low administrative complexity since it operates through existing tax infrastructure, provides fast cash delivery within months. Evidence shows additionality: RDEC demonstrates £2.40-£2.70 of additional R&D per £1 of public money, while the SME scheme shows £0.60-£1.28 per £1. Currently heavily utilised with 65,690 claims in 2022-23, showing strong business uptake."
      what_doesnt: "Limited strategic targeting capability - unsuitable when specific technologies or sectors need priority support. Moderate fraud risk (£1B lost in 2020-21). Fast cash delivery but slow economic impact - broader benefits like productivity gains emerge over years."
      additionality: "**Medium-High evidence** - Multiple studies show genuine additionality, though exact amounts are contested due to methodological debates."
      timeline: "Immediate cash flow benefits, long-term economic impact over 3-5 years."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Use as part of a broad-based innovation strategy, particularly in service-driven economies like the UK."
      - "Not suitable when strategic targeting of specific technologies, sectors, or regions is the priority."
      - "Consider combining with direct grants to address strategic priorities that tax credits cannot target."
      - "Build robust anti-fraud measures from the outset - this is critical for long-term success."
      - "The UK's heavy reliance on tax credits versus direct measures may not adequately address manufacturing competitiveness or strategic technology priorities like AI or clean energy."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "HMRC"
      ease: "**Low complexity** – operates through existing tax infrastructure, with administrative costs pushed to beneficiaries"
      flexibility: "**Medium** – tax changes can be introduced at fiscal events, but major changes can prove controversial without adequate consultation"

  - name: "Innovation inducement prizes"
    tag: "innovation_inducement_prizes"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "Unlock breakthrough solutions in situations where the desired end product is clear but the development path is uncertain. Aims to draw in non-traditional solvers who might not typically engage with government R&D programs and raise the salience of important problems that need innovative solutions."
      optimal_conditions: "Most effective at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) around 3, where technical risk is high and the ideal innovator is unknown. Works particularly well when publicity value is important for highlighting a problem or building a community around a challenge."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "The government offers a monetary prize against clearly defined success criteria, with entrants funding their own R&D efforts and claiming the prize only if they meet the specified goal. This approach shifts risk to participants while providing strong incentives for breakthrough solutions. Prizes can be structured with multiple stages or milestone payments to maintain momentum throughout development."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**Variable** – can target any sector by choice of prize theme"
      technological: "**High** – success criteria can pinpoint a single specific technical goal"
      regional: "**Low** – the geographic location of winners is difficult to steer or predict"
      by_firm_type: "**Moderate** – typical beneficiaries tend to be start-ups and SMEs with lower overhead costs"
      overall_assessment: "**Precise but narrow** – best suited for focused technical challenges with clear success metrics."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Government only pays for successful outcomes, eliminating the risk of funding failed projects. Leverage can reach 10:1 in large prizes as participants invest their own resources. Can attract unconventional innovators and generate significant publicity for important challenges. UK examples include the Manchester Prize (£1 million for AI applications in clean energy) and Longitude Prizes - these represent modest experiments with particular promise for spotlighting early-stage challenges in net zero transition or national security areas."
      what_doesnt: "Prize design and evaluation processes are complex and resource-intensive. Risk of duplication as multiple teams work on similar approaches without coordination. Evidence base for effectiveness remains thin, making it difficult to predict outcomes or optimise design."
      additionality: "**Low-Medium evidence** - Additionality likely to be high when a precise target product profile is established, but approach remains untested when rewards simply go to 'best in class' without clear performance thresholds."
      timeline: "Dependent on prize duration and complexity, typically requires years for meaningful technical breakthroughs. Impact may be accelerated if prizes successfully catalyse broader investment or research interest."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Reserve innovation prizes for problems at TRL approximately 3 where the pool of potential innovators is unknown or needs to be expanded beyond traditional players."
      - "Keep R&D costs relatively low for entrants to maximize participation, and guard against overly generic criteria that fail to drive specific innovation."
      - "Consider prizes as part of broader innovation ecosystems rather than standalone interventions."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "DSIT, Innovate UK, Nesta"
      ease: "**High complexity** – requires specialist technical assessors, extensive outreach and communications, often staged payment systems"
      flexibility: "**Variable** – once launched, prize terms are difficult to alter without undermining credibility, but new prizes can be designed to respond to emerging challenges"

  - name: "Advance market commitments"
    tag: "advance_market_commitments"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "Create a guaranteed market that spurs both invention and production scaling in areas where demand uncertainty is a major barrier to private investment. Particularly valuable for creating entirely new markets or accelerating the development of products with high social value but uncertain commercial demand."
      optimal_conditions: "Most effective at TRL 3-5 where technical feasibility is emerging but market demand is highly uncertain. Works best when fixed production costs are high, few alternative buyers exist, and the social value of the innovation significantly exceeds likely private returns."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "Government makes an upfront commitment to purchase or subsidize a future product that meets a specified target profile, thereby reducing demand uncertainty and encouraging private investment in R&D and scale-up. The commitment provides a guaranteed market for innovations that meet predetermined criteria, with payment typically contingent on delivery of products meeting agreed specifications."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**Moderate** – frequently used in life sciences, net zero technologies, and defense applications"
      technological: "**High** – target product profiles can provide precise technical specifications and performance requirements"
      regional: "**Low** – difficult to control where production and innovation activities locate"
      by_firm_type: "**Low** – larger firms are typically better positioned to deliver at the scale required by government commitments"
      overall_assessment: "**Market-making tool** – powerful for creating new markets but capital-intensive and requires long-term commitment."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Can crowd in major private R&D investment by providing demand certainty that unlocks private capital. Government only pays upon successful delivery of specified products, minimizing risk of funding failure. Fraud risk is typically low due to clear delivery requirements and product verification processes. UK has participated in international pneumococcal and COVAX vaccine commitments, with a pilot program for low-carbon concrete underway."
      what_doesnt: "Potentially very expensive if successful, requiring substantial long-term budget commitments. Design complexity is high, requiring detailed technical specifications and market analysis. Vulnerable to industry capture if incumbent players unduly influence specification setting."
      additionality: "**Low-Medium evidence** - Additionality effects remain unclear from existing studies. Economic theory suggests high additionality where products are distant from current market viability, but empirical evidence is limited."
      timeline: "Typically extends beyond a single parliamentary term, depending on starting TRL and required scale-up. Long-term nature creates challenges for political sustainability."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Deploy advance market commitments specifically when demand risk is the primary constraint on private investment, rather than technical or regulatory barriers."
      - "Avoid using this tool for products that are already near-market viability, as this risks displacing rather than additional private investment."
      - "Maintain credible long-term funding commitments even across changes of government, as credibility is essential for effectiveness."
      - "Shows particular promise for pandemic preparedness and hard-to-abate net zero technologies where uncertain future carbon pricing creates investment barriers."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "HM Treasury, BEIS or successor, Innovate UK"
      ease: "**High complexity** – requires detailed technical specification development, ongoing monitoring, often complex international coordination"
      flexibility: "**Low** – commitments must remain credible and stable over many years to provide effective investment signals"

  - name: "Grants for collaborative R&D"
    tag: "grants_for_collaborative_rd"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "To de-risk innovation and drive technological progress by supporting R&D collaboration between businesses and academia. The grants help academics address real-world challenges while enabling businesses to access new skills, data, and equipment. The overall goal is to drive UK comparative advantage, growth, and security."
      optimal_conditions: "This is a versatile tool effective across all Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), from use-inspired basic research through to adoption and commercialisation. It is often targeted at specific sectors or technologies, and almost always requires co-investment from the lead business partner."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "Public funding is provided through grants that mandate collaboration between multiple parties, typically businesses and academic institutions, as a condition of the award. The level of targeting can vary, from broad sectors to specific technologies and technical challenges. Co-investment from the lead business, usually in the form of match-funding, is a near-universal requirement. Programmes range from small-scale projects for knowledge exchange to multi-year, multi-million pound initiatives aimed at solving major challenges."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**High** – Can be targeted to specific sectors."
      technological: "**High** – Can be targeted to specific technologies and technical challenges."
      regional: "**Moderate** – Could be targeted by region."
      by_firm_type: "**High** – Can be targeted by firm size, with greater impacts noted for smaller firms."
      overall_assessment: "**Powerful targeted tool for de-risking innovation** – Fosters diversity in R&D, with most grants aimed at driving UK strategic advantages."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Evidence supports a positive link between collaborative R&D support, innovation, and firm growth. In the UK, these grants yield higher returns than other types in the Innovate UK portfolio. The requirement for match-funding often results in significant private sector leverage; for instance, the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund's £2.82bn investment secured £4.65bn in match funding, which is expected to grow to £8.19bn. Impacts are greatest for SMEs and firms in high-tech manufacturing and knowledge-intensive sectors."
      what_doesnt: "Tensions over intellectual property can slow or derail projects if not addressed early. Funding scarcity can lead to the formation of 'tokenistic' collaborations. Large, complex programmes carry a significant administrative burden, and grant application timelines can be misaligned with the faster pace of industry."
      additionality: "**Medium-High evidence** - Multiple studies show genuine additionality, although the specific findings can vary based on the grant type, sector, technology, company type, and geography."
      timeline: "Variable, depending on the TRL stage the grant is targeting."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Continue to foster a diverse range of collaborative R&D grant types, with a majority targeted at sectors and technologies that drive UK comparative advantage, growth, and security."
      - "Ensure administration is handled by expert leaders with sufficient autonomy, citing the Aerospace Technology Institute as an exemplar."
      - "Create stronger connections with policymakers to highlight industry challenges, which could accelerate market readiness and adoption of innovations."
      - "Encourage Innovate UK to act swiftly to fill the strategic gap in responsive, non-targeted collaborative grants left by the termination of its Smart Grants programme."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "Expert bodies (e.g., Innovate UK, Aerospace Technology Institute)"
      ease: "**Medium Complexity** – Varies depending on the specificity of the funding target and the number of partners involved."
      flexibility: "**High Flexibility** – The tool can be designed to achieve a wide variety of different outcomes."

    tag: "contracts_for_innovation"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "Help public sector organisations solve challenges by connecting them with innovative businesses to develop cutting-edge and cost-effective solutions. Addresses situations where the market is unlikely to provide solutions independently, particularly for government-specific needs and public sector challenges."
      optimal_conditions: "Most effective at TRL 3-9 where technical solutions are feasible but market incentives are insufficient. Works particularly well when government can act as lead customer and where clear problem statements can be defined with measurable success criteria."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "Public sector organisations run Contracts for Innovation competitions by posing specific problem statements, with companies competing for contracts to develop R&D solutions. The government acts as lead customer, with contracts typically structured in phases: feasibility studies, prototype/product development, and operational testing with public procurement of innovative solutions. This approach shifts from specifying solutions to defining problems that need solving."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**High** – competitions can target specific government department needs or cross-cutting public sector challenges"
      technological: "**High** – problem statements can define precise technical requirements and performance specifications"
      regional: "**Low** – whilst devolved nations make use of the programme, recipients are not regionally targeted"
      by_firm_type: "**Moderate** – accessible to businesses, academic and research organisations, charities and not-for-profits, though businesses constitute the majority of recipients"
      overall_assessment: "**Problem-focused tool** – excellent for addressing specific government challenges but requires active departmental engagement."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Positive impact relatively well evidenced at firm level with high additionality rates. Government only pays for solutions that meet specified criteria, reducing risk of funding failures. Flexible model adaptable to wide range of departments and agencies. Strong leverage demonstrated in healthcare sector with £290m+ private investment from £99m+ public investment. Operating successfully since 2001 with over 100 public sector organisations participating, representing over £1 billion in total spend."
      what_doesnt: "Key challenge is limited traction within many parts of the public sector due to well-recognised structural barriers. Requires extensive departmental administrative resources for success. Public sector benefits remain inadequately evaluated. Significant variation in how different departments interpret and deploy the programme."
      additionality: "**High evidence** - 60% of beneficiaries report projects would not have happened without support, with additional 25% saying projects would have proceeded in reduced form. Gross additional turnover impact of £127k per firm per year."
      timeline: "Several years for full spectrum of outcomes, depending on complexity of challenge and required TRL progression."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Require strategic leadership and funding commitment from the centre to drive more extensive adoption across government departments."
      - "Upgrade monitoring framework and data quality to better demonstrate public sector benefits and optimise programme design."
      - "Maintain flexibility whilst sharing best practice across the programme 'family' to improve consistency and effectiveness."
      - "Invest in raising awareness and building capabilities within procurement, policy, and innovation teams across government."
      - "Make greater use of Phase 3 (operational testing and public procurement) to improve adoption of innovative solutions."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "Multiple departments and agencies, coordinated guidance available"
      ease: "**High complexity** – requires extensive departmental administrative resource, specialist technical assessment, and ongoing project monitoring"
      flexibility: "**High** – adaptable model that can be tailored to specific departmental needs and challenge areas"

  - name: "Skilled immigration"
    tag: "skilled_immigration"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "Increase the supply of high-skilled talent in the UK to address skills shortages and enhance innovation capacity. Particularly valuable for accessing global talent pools and bringing in individuals with cutting-edge expertise that may be scarce domestically, whilst potentially catalysing additional private R&D investment through entrepreneurship."
      optimal_conditions: "Most effective when skills are genuinely undersupplied domestically and when programmes prioritise merit-based selection over lottery systems. Works particularly well when combined with schemes that promote collaboration between migrants and existing residents."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "Government enables high-skilled talent to migrate to the UK through targeted visa schemes. Key programmes include the Global Talent Visa (5-year duration for recognised leaders), High Potential Individual Visa (2-3 years for graduates from top universities), and Innovator Founder Visa (3 years for innovative business founders). Applications involve endorsement processes, qualification verification, and various fees including healthcare surcharges."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**Moderate** – Global Talent Visa targets specific sectors including science, medicine, engineering, FinTech, gaming, cybersecurity and AI"
      technological: "**Medium** – cannot precisely control technological focus but existing programmes already target specific high-innovation industries"
      regional: "**Low** – difficult to direct innovation benefits to specific geographic regions"
      by_firm_type: "**High** – benefits universities, large firms, and start-ups, with immigrants more likely to establish new businesses"
      overall_assessment: "**Talent supply tool** – effective for addressing skills gaps but limited geographical targeting capability."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Revenue-generating policy that lacks fiscal costs whilst crowding in extensive private R&D investment. Fast impact timeline with innovation effects visible within one year. Evidence shows 1 percentage point rise in immigrant college graduates increases patents per capita by 6%. Between 2020-2023, granted 12,243 Global Talent visas, 1,342 High Potential Individual visas, and 520 Innovator Founder visas. Evaluation shows 30% of Global Talent visa holders conducting research by mid-2021."
      what_doesnt: "Immigration reform traditionally slow to implement. Mixed evidence on effects on native innovation depending on programme design - lottery-style programmes risk crowding out domestic innovation. Some visa applicants report longer than expected application processing times. High upfront costs may deter applicants compared to competitor nations."
      additionality: "**Mixed evidence** - Points-based systems likely to crowd in innovation, whilst lottery-based systems may crowd out domestic innovation. Effect depends heavily on specific programme design and implementation."
      timeline: "Fast implementation once programmes established - innovation impacts visible within one year of migration."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Prioritise merit-based selection over lottery systems to maximise innovation benefits."
      - "Focus programmes on postgraduate degree holders and undersupplied skills areas."
      - "Include potential start-up founders rather than restricting to job offer holders."
      - "Benchmark visa costs against competitor nations to maintain competitiveness in attracting talent."
      - "Change healthcare surcharge payment schedule to annual rather than upfront to reduce barriers."
      - "Create voluntary opt-in connections between skilled migrants and existing research networks and start-up ecosystems."
      - "Extend High Potential Individual Visa length for degrees in critical demand occupations."

    # IMPLEMENTATION

  - name: "Regulatory sandboxes"
    tag: "regulatory_sandboxes"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "Supports regulatory innovation and reduces regulatory costs for innovative firms. Regulators create sandboxes to pilot new products, services, or business models with live customers for a set period. The lessons learned are used to refine permanent rules and future market approvals."
      optimal_conditions: "Most effective in tightly regulated sectors with significant regulatory uncertainty. Works best when the regulator has enough capacity, operates transparently, and intends to share the benefits with firms not participating in the sandbox. The tool is particularly useful around Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, where regulatory hurdles can impede development."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "Sector regulators invite groups of innovators into a sandbox to test new offerings with real customers for a limited time. Each participating firm operates with bespoke regulatory relief, such as tailored waivers or modified license conditions, which are agreed upon beforehand. The process includes predefined entry criteria, consumer-protection safeguards, and data-sharing obligations, all enforced through close supervision. At the end of the trial, firms must either transition to the full regulatory regime or exit the market."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**High** – Can be targeted by sector, with UK examples in aviation, fintech, and energy."
      technological: "**High** – Can target specific technologies; existing UK sandboxes focus on areas like cell-cultured meat and 'AI as a medical device'."
      regional: "**Low** – Sandboxes are typically run by national regulators, making it difficult to direct innovation to specific geographic areas."
      by_firm_type: "**High** – Regulators can prioritize access for start-ups and SMEs, which may struggle more with regulatory costs."
      overall_assessment: "**Flexible tool** – Supports regulatory innovation and lowers regulatory costs for innovative companies."

    # EFFECTIVENESS

      what_works: "Effectiveness is improved by involving regulators directly, transparently reporting on progress to benefit non-participating firms, and not pre-specifying the regulatory exemptions. Using clear, objective access criteria and clarifying that entry is not a regulatory endorsement helps prevent unfair market advantages."
      what_doesnt: "Poor transparency can create disadvantages for firms outside the sandbox. The tool is vulnerable to regulatory capture by participating companies and high operational costs can divert resources from other regulatory functions."
      additionality: "**Low-Medium evidence** – Evidence is limited, but one UK study found that entry into a fintech sandbox increased a firm's capital raised by 15%, its probability of raising capital by 50%, and its chances of a patent grant by 1.9%, while lowering the probability of business failure by 14.2% compared to similar non-participating firms."
      timeline: "Impacts can be seen relatively quickly; evidence from a UK fintech sandbox shows positive effects on capital raising within one quarter and on patenting within two years."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Use in tightly regulated sectors around TRL 7, where regulatory uncertainty is a significant barrier to further development."
      - "Improve effectiveness by actively sharing learnings across the regulator and relevant industries, including with firms that do not participate in the sandbox."
      - "Achieve broader diffusion of knowledge by having regulators transparently report their findings."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "Sector regulators (e.g., for FinTech, energy, aviation)"
      ease: "**High complexity** – Requires specialist expertise to design transparent eligibility rules and appropriate consumer safeguards."
      flexibility: "**High** – The size of cohorts, duration of the sandbox, and conditions of regulatory relief can be adjusted between rounds, and lessons can be quickly integrated into wider rule changes."

    tag: "innovation_loans"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "To support firms, particularly innovative SMEs, in overcoming financing gaps for late-stage R&D and bringing prototypes to market."
      optimal_conditions: "Most effective for supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and manufacturing firms. They are best suited for technologies at a late stage of development, around TRL 6-8, to address funding gaps for scaling, regulatory validation, and market entry."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "Public bodies, such as Innovate UK, provide below-market rate loans to businesses to support R&D activities. These programs typically focus on innovative SMEs undertaking late-stage projects. Applicants undergo a competitive assessment based on the quality of their innovation and its commercial potential."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**High** – Loans can be restricted to specific sectors, with evidence suggesting greater benefits for manufacturing firms."
      technological: "**High** – Can be targeted to late-stage technologies (TRL 6-8) where the benefits are likely greatest."
      regional: "**High** – It is possible to restrict innovation loans to firms within specific geographic regions."
      by_firm_type: "**High** – Loans can be limited to SMEs, for which the benefits are larger."
      overall_assessment: "**Targeted tool** – Supports firms to bring prototypes to market and works best for SMEs, manufacturing, and late-stage innovation."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Supporting SMEs with loans is more likely to crowd-in private R&D investment compared to supporting large firms. Focusing on manufacturing businesses also helps attract more private R&D funding. A rigorous technical assessment process helps direct funds to commercially promising innovations. Furthermore, combining loans with grants can complement each other for SMEs, encouraging additional private investment."
      what_doesnt: "Loan terms can create a 'moral hazard' if repayment is linked to revenue instead of profit, or if forgiveness terms are too permissive, as this may disincentivize firms from pursuing commercialization."
      additionality: "**Low evidence** – Evidence is limited, but a study of Spanish firms indicated that receiving an innovation loan made a firm 24.9% more likely to invest its own resources in R&D. While state-backed loans might have a signaling effect that helps secure private follow-on funding, it is not clear if this generates new investment or simply reallocates existing capital."
      timeline: "The crowding-in effects on private R&D investment can happen within the first year of the loan being issued."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Use innovation loans to support SMEs and manufacturing firms with technologies around TRL 6-8 to bridge finance gaps for scaling and market entry."
      - "Improve effectiveness by avoiding loan repayment terms linked to turnover and by not having overly permissive forgiveness clauses."
      - "Consider offering grants in conjunction with loans for SMEs to maximize the crowding-in of additional private R&D investment."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "Public bodies (e.g., Innovate UK)"
      ease: "**High Complexity** – Requires capabilities for credit assessment, technical due diligence, and portfolio risk management."
      flexibility: "**Low Flexibility** – Loan agreements span multiple years, which restricts the ability to quickly reallocate funding to other priorities."
