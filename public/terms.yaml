  - name: "R&D"

  - name: "TRL"
    description: "Technology Readiness Level. TRLs are a standard scale for categorising technology maturity, from initial concept (TRL 1) to full operational deployment (TRL 9). Originally developed by NASA, TRLs help decision-makers gauge risk, readiness, and investment needs across research, development, testing, and deployment phases. The reader does not need to know every level; the key concept is that technologies move through the levels until they are deployable, with potential pitfalls at each stage."
  - name: "SMEs"
    description: "Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. Businesses that fall below certain size thresholds in terms of employee numbers, annual turnover, or balance sheet totals. In the UK, SMEs typically have fewer than 250 employees and annual turnover under £50 million."
  - name: "Leverage"

  - name: "UKRI"
    description: "UK Research and Innovation. The UK's national funding agency for research and innovation, formed in 2018 by bringing together the seven disciplinary Research Councils, Innovate UK, and Research England."
  - name: "peer review"
    description: "A process where research proposals or outputs are evaluated by independent experts in the same field. Used to assess scientific quality and merit before funding decisions are made."
  - name: "Catapult Centres"
    description: "A network of technology and innovation centres in the UK that provide businesses with access to specialist equipment, expertise, and facilities to accelerate innovation and commercialisation."

  - name: "moral hazard"
